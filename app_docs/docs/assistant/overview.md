        *   **Message Field:** For text input.
        *   **Send Button:** To submit your message.
        *   **Attachment Button:** (Often a paperclip icon) Allows you to attach files (images, documents) to your messages for the AI to process.
        *   **Voice Input Button:** (Often a microphone icon) For voice-to-text input.
        *   **New Chat Button:** To quickly start a fresh conversation.

5.  **Clara Sidebar (Session Management):**
    *   Usually on the right side of the chat interface.
    *   Lists your recent chat sessions.
    *   Allows you to:
        *   Select a previous session to continue the conversation.
        *   Start a new chat session.
        *   Perform actions on sessions like renaming (often automatic based on first message), deleting, starring, or archiving.
        *   Load more sessions if the list is long.

## Interacting with Messages

*   **Copying Messages:** Most messages will have an option to easily copy their content to your clipboard.
*   **Retrying Messages:** If an AI response fails or is unsatisfactory, there might be an option to retry generating the response.
*   **Editing Messages:** You might be able to edit your previously sent messages.
*   **Artifacts:** AI responses can include "artifacts" like executable code blocks, data tables, or generated images. These are often displayed in a special way and may have their own interaction options.

## Key Modes of Operation

Clara Assistant can operate in different modes, affecting how it generates responses and uses its capabilities:

*   **Streaming Mode:**
    *   Designed for faster, continuous output, similar to how many chatbots respond.
    *   In this mode, advanced features like Autonomous Agent capabilities and complex tool usage are typically disabled to ensure smooth streaming.
*   **Tools Mode (or Non-Streaming Mode):**
    *   Allows Clara to leverage its full potential, including using external tools (via MCP) and engaging its Autonomous Agent features for complex tasks.
    *   Responses might take longer to generate as Clara "thinks" and performs actions.

You can usually switch between these modes via the **Advanced Options** panel in the chat input area.
