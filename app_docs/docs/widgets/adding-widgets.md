Desktop widgets in Clara provide at-a-glance information and quick access to functionalities directly from your main dashboard or a dedicated widgets area. This guide shows you how to add, arrange, and manage these widgets.

## Accessing the "Add Widget" Modal

To add new widgets, you'll typically need to open an "Add Widget" modal or panel.

1.  **Locate the "Add Widget" Control:**
    *   Look for a button or icon on your dashboard, often labeled "+" or "Add Widget."
    *   It might also be an option in a context menu if you right-click on an empty area of the dashboard.

2.  **Open the Modal:**
    *   Clicking this control will open the "Add Widget" modal, which displays a list of available widgets.

## Browsing Available Widgets

The "Add Widget" modal usually categorizes widgets for easier navigation:

*   **System Widgets:**
    *   Provide general information or system-related functionalities.
    *   Examples: "Welcome" (intro to Clara), "Privacy Notice," "What's New" (latest updates).
*   **Data Widgets:**
    *   Display data from external sources.
    *   Example: "Custom Webhook" (shows data from a user-configured API).
*   **Productivity Widgets:**
    *   Offer tools to enhance your workflow.
    *   Examples: "Quick Chat" (direct chat with an AI model), "Email Inbox" (shows recent emails from a configured source).
*   **Apps & Agents Category:**
    *   This special category allows you to add your custom-built **[Apps (Agents)](../app-creator/introduction.md)** as widgets. This is a powerful way to bring your automated workflows directly to your dashboard.

## Adding a Widget to Your Dashboard

1.  **Select a Category:** Click on a category to see the widgets within it.
2.  **Choose a Widget:** Browse the list of widgets. Each widget usually shows an icon, name, and a brief description. Some might also show a small preview.
3.  **Click to Select:** Click on the widget you want to add. It might become highlighted.
4.  **Configure (if necessary):**
    *   Some widgets (like "Welcome" or "Privacy Notice") can be added directly.
    *   Other widgets (like "Quick Chat," "Custom Webhook," or "Email Inbox") require configuration before they can be added. If you select one of these, a configuration form will typically appear within the modal. See **[Configuring Widgets](./configuring-widgets.md)** for details.
    *   For "App" widgets from the "Apps & Agents" category, selecting the app will usually add it directly, using its pre-defined functionality.
5.  **Confirm Addition:**
    *   Once a widget is selected (and configured, if needed), click the "Add Widget," "Confirm," or similar button in the modal.
    *   The modal will close, and the new widget will appear on your dashboard.

## Managing Widgets on Your Dashboard

Once widgets are on your dashboard, you can usually manage them in several ways:

*   **Moving Widgets:**
    *   Click and drag a widget to a new position on the dashboard. The layout might be grid-based or free-form.
*   **Resizing Widgets:**
    *   Some widgets may be resizable. Look for resize handles (often on the corners or edges) that appear when you hover over or select a widget. Click and drag these handles to change the widget's size.

*   **Removing Widgets:**
    *   Widgets usually have a close button (an 'X' icon) or an option in a context menu (right-click on the widget) to remove them from the dashboard.
*   **Editing Widget Configuration:**
    *   For configurable widgets, there might be a settings icon (cogwheel) or a context menu option to re-open their configuration form.
*   **Resetting to Default Layout:**
    *   The "Add Widget" modal or a dashboard settings menu might offer an option to "Reset to Default" widgets, which would revert your widget layout to a predefined state.
